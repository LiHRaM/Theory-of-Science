# Exercise 1

## A
> For each of the four hypotheses,
>
> Determine whether it is a one sample performance hypothesis, or a two-sample comparative hypothesis
>
> Perform a preliminary investigation of the plausibility of the hypothesis using descriptive analysis tools (boxplots, histograms, biplots,...)

### H1
> The probability that a student gets question 1 right is 50%

1. One-sample performance analysis.
2. A histogram shows the columns are roughly of the same size, with slightly fewer students answering incorrectly.

### H2
> The average total that students obtain is less than 50 points.

1. One-sample performance analysis.
2. 
### H3
> BLA students get better exam results than CRU students

1. Two-sample comparative analysis.

### H4
> Question 5 is more difficult than question 8

1. Two-sample comparative analysis.
